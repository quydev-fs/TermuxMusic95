# TermuxMusic95

*An X11-based MP3 player for Termux, inspired by WinAMP 2.x and written entirely in C++.*

## 🚀 Overview

**TermuxMusic95** brings the nostalgic look and functionality of WinAMP 2.x to Android’s Termux environment. With a familiar GUI rendered via X11, robust MP3 playback thanks to `mpg123`, PulseAudio integration, and real-time spectrum visualizations via FFT, this project demonstrates what’s possible with modern terminal environments on Android.

## ✨ Features

- Classic WinAMP-inspired graphical user interface (X11)
- MP3 playback with metadata support (`mpg123`)
- PulseAudio streaming
- Real-time spectrum analyzer (FFT-based)
- Keyboard and mouse controls
- Playlist and folder support
